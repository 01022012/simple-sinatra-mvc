# Simple Sinatra MVC Template

## What's included
Sprockets, HAML, SASS, PostgreSQL gem (pg), coffee-script and more


``` bash
$ git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/katgironpe/simple-sinatra-mvc.git myapp
$ rm -r myapp/.git && rm myapp/README.md
```


## Use bundler to install gems
``` bash
$ bundle install
```

## Start the app

``` bash
$ rackup
```

## Unit and acceptance tests

Ruby 1.9 includes minitest so it just makes test to use minitest instead of any other framework.
It works and it is simple. Use:

``` bash
$ rake test
```

For acceptance tests, some example is also provided. Use:

cucumber or rake features should work

## Configuration

``` bash
$ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
```

Update database.yml


By default, we use PostgreSQL.

You may have to update config.ru as needed.

The Rakefile may require some updates for sprockets. As you add more assets, you would need to precompile those for production.


## Rake Tasks

``` bash
$ rake -T
```

rake assets:clean         # Clean assets
rake assets:precompile    # Precompile assets
rake db:create_migration  # create an ActiveRecord migration
rake db:migrate           # migrate the database (use version with VERSION=n)
rake db:rollback          # roll back the migration (use steps with STEP=n)
rake db:schema:dump       # dump schema into file
rake db:schema:load       # load schema into database
rake features             # Run Cucumber features

To create a database for a specific environment, do:

``` bash
$ rake db:create RACK_ENV=production
```

The default environment is "development"

To create a migration file called "create_pages", do:

``` bash
$ rake db:create_migration NAME=create_pages
```

To do migration:

``` bash
$ rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=production
```

To rollback:

``` bash
$ rake db:rollback RACK_ENV=production
```

The default is development so this should just work:

``` bash
$ rake db:migrate
```


## Asset Pipeline

Yes, it is very easy to get asset pipeline working for Sinatra. By default, we have the following supported directories:

* app/assets/javascripts
* app/assets/stylesheets
* app/assets/images

You may append more paths as needed.

```ruby
sprockets.append_path File.join(root, 'app', 'assets', 'fonts')
```

To precompile assets, simply use the rake task for it either on your deployment file or locally:

```bash
rake assets:precompile
```
